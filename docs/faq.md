# Modelify FAQ

## Can you stack modals?
Yes. If you call `Modelify.info("A modal")` and then `Modelify.info("A second modal")` for example, the modal with "A second modal" would appear **on top of** the other modal.
Once the top modal is dismissed, the next modal will automatically appear.

## Why did you create Modelify?
I made this because I couldn't find a simple interface that let you create modal popups and I needed those for a project.
Now I've pushlished this online to try and help some other people out!
